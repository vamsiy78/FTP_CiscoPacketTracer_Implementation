# File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Simulation on Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview

This repository contains the details and documentation for a mini-project focused on simulating the **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** within a controlled network environment using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of file transfer mechanisms and network configuration principles.

## Introduction

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a fundamental application layer protocol that facilitates the transfer of files between a client and a server on a computer network. This simulation aims to demonstrate the practical application and underlying mechanics of FTP, moving beyond theoretical concepts.

## Objectives

* To comprehend the functions and operational flow of the FTP protocol.
* To explore the role and configuration of FTP servers within a network.
* To gain hands-on experience in configuring and verifying file transfers using Cisco Packet Tracer.
* To analyze the significance of various configuration steps and troubleshoot common issues.

## Network Topology

The simulated network employs a basic but functional topology designed to demonstrate FTP operations. It typically includes:

* **Switches:** To enable communication between devices.
* **FTP Servers:** Configured as dedicated repositories for file storage and retrieval.
* **Client Devices (PCs):** Set up to initiate file uploads and downloads.

## Configuration Steps

The simulation involved meticulous configuration of both FTP servers and client devices.

### 1. FTP Server Configuration

* **Enabling FTP Services:** Activated the FTP daemon on the server device.
* **User Account Management:** Created specific FTP user accounts (e.g., username, password) with defined access permissions (read, write, delete, list).
* **Directory Management:** Set up virtual directories or managed physical directories on the server for file storage.

### 2. Client Configuration

* **Network Connectivity:** Ensured client devices had proper IP addresses and could communicate with the FTP server (e.g., using `ping`).
* **FTP Client Software:** Used the built-in FTP client on the Packet Tracer PCs (accessible via Command Prompt within the PC).
* **File Operations:** Performed commands like `put` (upload) and `get` (download) to transfer files.

## Simulation Details

The simulation commenced with clients initiating file transfers (both uploads and downloads) to the designated FTP server using the configured FTP protocol. The FTP server successfully processed these requests, demonstrating seamless exchange of files.

## Observations and Results

* **Successful Communication:** All devices in the topology established successful network communication.
* **Smooth File Transfers:** Clients were able to reliably upload files to and download files from the FTP server.
* **Configuration Sensitivity:** The simulation highlighted the critical importance of accurate FTP server and client configurations for uninterrupted file transfer operations. Minor misconfigurations could lead to connection issues or failed transfers.

## Analysis

### Significance of Steps in File Transfer

Each step, from setting up user accounts and permissions on the server to correctly inputting commands on the client, is vital for the integrity and security of file transfers. FTP provides a standardized method, fostering interoperability.

### Challenges Encountered

While largely successful, the project presented opportunities to troubleshoot common FTP configuration issues, particularly related to user authentication, directory permissions, and network connectivity between the client and server. These challenges reinforced the need for meticulous setup and verification.
